However, after updated to ES6 module, the url somehow doesn't value the <code>__webpack_public_path__</code> set in the entry point <code>app.ts</code>. Thus, many failed font requests.</p>\n<p>Well, the reason is that import statements are always hoisted in es6 module, so the <code>__webpack_public_path__</code> initialization in the first line of <code>app.ts</code> didn't have any effects in those hoisted import statements including the <code>css</code> file. So, after putting the webpack_public_path initialization into a separation file and get it imported into app.ts, problem resolved!</p>","createdAt":"2019-01-29T12:54:03Z","labels":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"post"}},{"node":{"name":"webpack"}}]}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":8}}
